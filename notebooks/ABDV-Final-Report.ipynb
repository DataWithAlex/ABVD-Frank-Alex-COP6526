    "# Agent-Based Video Distortion (ABVD)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Structure of the Digital Petri Dish](../assets/notebook-images/Structure.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project is on a special method we developed for video distortion. Most distortion tools translate the color values of the source pixel or exploit the quirks in compression algorithms to create what's called 'data moshing'. However, independently the term data moshing evokes crowds of people pushing into one another at a punk show—got us thinking if we could use agent-based modeling to make pixels mosh.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we thought about an image as a petri dish, filled with all different kinds of nutrients and poisons, and the pixels as bacteria moving towards nutrients and away from poisons. Then, video frames are just a snapshot of a petri dish in time, followed by another petri dish in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal, then, is to create an agent (or bacteria) that will create visually interesting effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've created a system where pixels behave like microscopic organisms, responding to their environment in ways that create emergent visual patterns. Each video frame becomes a moment in time of this digital ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Digital Petri Dish\n",
    "\n",
    "In our model, each frame is treated as a nutrient environment where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Light areas are \"nutrients\" that attract our pixel-organisms\n",
    "- Dark areas are \"toxic\" zones that organisms try to avoid\n",
    "- Pixels can mutate their colors based on environmental pressures\n",
    "- Population dynamics emerge from birth and death cycles\n",
    "\n",
    "This biological metaphor creates organic, flowing distortions that feel more alive than traditional effects.\n",

These functions enable the agents to navigate their environment effectively, responding to the lightness of their surroundings and making decisions that influence their movement patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inactive Test Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `inactive_test` function adds an element of randomness to the despawning of agents. It evaluates whether an agent should be marked inactive based on its exposure to \"toxic\" areas, represented by dark pixels. This function uses a probabilistic approach, influenced by the agent's unattractive steps and a global parameter, to determine if an agent should be removed from the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivated Move Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `motivated_move` function is designed to simulate a gradient ascent behavior, where pixel agents are attracted to brighter areas of the frame. This function evaluates potential positions and selects the one with the highest lightness value, encouraging agents to move towards \"nutrient-rich\" areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Move Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `move!` function governs the movement logic of each pixel agent. It incorporates randomness to prevent stagnation and uses the lightness of the current pixel to determine movement strategy. The function also checks if an agent should be marked inactive using the `inactive_test` function.\n",

    "- **Unmotivated Movement (M1):** Occurs in the lightest areas, where agents make small, random movements.\n",
    "- **Motivated Movement (M2):** In light areas, agents are more directed, seeking brighter pixels.\n",
    "- **Motivated Movement (M3):** In darker areas, agents make longer, directed movements to find brighter regions.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `motivated_move` function iterates over all possible positions an agent can move to, evaluating the lightness of each position. It selects the position with the highest lightness, simulating a natural attraction to brighter areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `move!` function is more complex, incorporating several movement strategies based on the lightness of the current pixel:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Random Movement:** Introduces a 10% chance for the agent to move randomly, which helps in exploring new areas and prevents the system from becoming static.\n",
    "- **Brightness-Based Movement:** Adjusts the movement strategy based on the lightness of the current pixel:\n",
    "  - **Very Bright Areas (L > 0.7):** Agents make small random movements, simulating a stable environment.\n",
    "  - **Moderately Bright Areas (L > 0.5):** Agents perform medium-range directed movements towards brighter pixels.\n",
    "  - **Dark Areas (L ≤ 0.5):** Agents engage in long-range directed movements, searching for brighter areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `inactive_test` function plays a crucial role in this system by determining when an agent should be marked inactive, adding a layer of realism to the simulation by mimicking the natural lifecycle of organisms. This movement logic, combined with the motivated move function, creates a dynamic and adaptive system where pixel agents continuously seek out optimal conditions, contributing to the emergent visual patterns in the video distortion process."

By treating each video frame as a digital petri dish, we simulate pixel agents that respond to their environment, resulting in emergent visual patterns that are both complex and aesthetically intriguing.\n",

This ensures that the notebook is not only executable but also serves as an educational resource for understanding the principles and applications of agent-based modeling in digital media.\n",
